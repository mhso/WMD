3. Run the Jar!
  - Either create a new game or continue where you left off from a previous one

  - Click on units to see their range, double click on them to see their upgrades
  - The level editor can be used to create your own cool levels
  - Create a path, either with the free-hand or line tool. Enemies will go down this path
